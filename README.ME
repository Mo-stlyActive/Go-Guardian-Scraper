A go program that scraps all links from a website. Doesn't do anything with that data currently.
done as part of series of projects to learn about Go from youtuber Akhil Sharma - https://www.youtube.com/@AkhilSharmaTech

Future goals:
- do something with the data

idea:
- look for certain references or mentions of specific information
- have a UI element where users can give a link and string or array of strings and return relevent information
